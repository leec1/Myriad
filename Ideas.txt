      * CommandBaseInstance:CommandBase
      * EnemyControllerInstance:EnemyController
      * DifficultyLevel:Enum
      * CREATE ROUND()
      * Game cycle:
         * Game start
            *  make CBI and ECI
         * Round start
            * All Players respawn with full? health regardless of previous round final state
            * pass players in, send eci round info
               * CBI spawns players
               * ECI spawns ais with their info
                  * Each round increases in difficulty ?
                  * If Final round, Spawns Boss
            * starts round
            * on ECI reporting 0 enemies remain ROUND OVER
            * on CBI report 0 players OR 0 health GAME OVER ( 0 CBI Health ? ) 0cbi health yeah because even if all soldiers die there are automated stuff/commanders units -- can’t do just 0 health cause then we could get to a stalemate, the auto turrets could be strong enough to hold off all AI advances well your commander is alive till the cbi isnt so he can still do shit -- changed ‘soldiers’ to ‘players’ k so since commanders cant be damaged the cbi can and if cbi goes to 0 health then it kills commander - that works
            * and commanders cant leave the cb until someone tried to replace them, like it says “send request to commander to switch” and you gotta click k
            * so you always have to have a commander
               * why not let the command base be unattended?
                  * Not ever likely but like leaving an empty net in hockey/soccer
                  * But leaving it unattended reduces health/quality of turrets so its easier to destroy
                  * and if destroyed, game over even if players live
                  * eh? ok yeah could work keep both ideas
